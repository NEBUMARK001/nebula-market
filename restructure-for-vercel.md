# Restructuring for Vercel Deployment

If you're still having issues with Vercel deployment, you can restructure your repository to move the Next.js app to the root directory.

## Option 1: Manual Restructure

1. **Move all files from `web/` to the root directory**:
   ```bash
   # Move all contents from web/ to root
   mv web/* .
   mv web/.* . 2>/dev/null || true
   rmdir web
   ```

2. **Update .gitignore** to include Next.js specific ignores at root level

3. **Update README.md** to reflect the new structure

## Option 2: Create a New Repository Structure

If you prefer to keep the current structure, you can:

1. **Create a new repository** with just the Next.js app
2. **Copy the `web/` directory contents** to the new repository root
3. **Deploy the new repository** to Vercel

## Option 3: Use Vercel CLI

1. **Install Vercel CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```

2. **Navigate to the web directory**:
   ```bash
   cd web
   ```

3. **Deploy from there**:
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

## Recommended Approach

The `vercel.json` file I created should resolve the issue. If it doesn't work:

1. Try **Solution 1** (setting root directory in Vercel dashboard)
2. If that fails, use **Option 3** (Vercel CLI from web directory)
3. As a last resort, use **Option 1** (restructure repository)

## Testing the Deployment

After deploying, your app should be available at:
- `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`
- Or your custom domain if configured

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Build failed - No package.json found"
**Solution**: Make sure the root directory is set to `web` in Vercel settings

### Issue: "Framework not detected"
**Solution**: The `vercel.json` file should resolve this by specifying `"framework": "nextjs"`

### Issue: "404 - Page not found"
**Solution**: Check that your Next.js app is properly configured and the build is successful
